                More on Numbers

Numbers are created by recursively checking characters in a string left to right until the character isn't a digit.
This will generate the starting and ending indices for a sequence of digits which gets converted into a decimal number
This decimal number then gets wrapped into a VALUE Node and added to the working tree.

Grammar model for a Number:
<num> = {<digit> | <digit><num>}
<digit> = {0 | ... | 9}

In words:
A number is a digit or a digit followed by a number, where digit is 0 or 1 or ... or 9.
